                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm Michelle and I'm in the second year of my PhD in Psychology at the University of Granada with supervision from the HIP lab at the University of Oxford, where I focus on computational cognition, neuroimaging, and artificial intelligence. My thesis currently focuses on investigating the interplay between spatial memory and categorization learning and exploring the neural mechanisms behind that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hold dual BS degrees in Biomedical Engineering and Chemical & Biological Engineering from Colorado State University, where I got interested in applying machine learning and data science to better understand brain processes in cognition, aging, and learning. My passion for data and modeling also led me to pursue and achieve a minor in Mathematics. I enjoy diving into the intersection of neuroscience and AI, exploring how computational models can deepen our understanding of the human brain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my journey, I've had the privilege of working across academia and industry, including roles in research at Colorado State University and as a data scientist/engineer at a SaaS/AI startup in Boulder, CO. Over the years I've developed expertise in neuroimaging analysis, loads of computational modeling, product development, and a taste of programming online psychology experiments.
